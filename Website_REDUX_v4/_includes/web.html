			<h2>Web.</h2>
			<p>I built this website using HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript. I started to build websites around the fourth grade (circa 2001). I was only using HTML at the time
			and wasn't interested learning any CSS or Javascript (and curiosity for what was beyond) didn't happen until high school. The site is hosted through 
			<a href="http://www.github.com/tjmaynes">GitHub</a> pages, which exclusively uses an engine called Jekyll (created by <a href="https://github.com/mojombo">Tom Preston-Werner</a> of Github)
			to generate a blog from static pages. 
			</p>
			<p>Optimizing my website under Jekyll gave myself a more intuitive and relaxing web-designing experience. 
			I'm quite thankful to have spent the time porting my old site to this Ruby-based engine.
			I would also like to thank <a href="http://malloc47.com">Jarrell Waggoner</a> for helping me understand 
			Jekyll as well as informing me of its' existence. Firefox is my favorite web browser and BBEdit is my text editor!

			<h2>Languages.</h2>
			<p>I'm currently learning the following languages: <em>MongoDB</em>, <em>Python</em>, and <em>Javascript</em> 
			(for web applications written in <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Nodejs</a>). <em>MongoDB</em> is a noSQL database that runs
			some of my favorite websites/applications which include: instagram, foursquare, etc. <em>Python</em> is a powerful 
			scripting language to learn and I enjoy it's syntax (I feel as though it has come easy for me to understand).
			<em>Javascript</em> is such a valued member in the web development community.
			</p>
			<p>I should also mention that I know a good bit about HTML and CSS. I've recently took more time in 
			learning Javascript, which I have come to find out, is a relief when building web apps.
			C++, I strongly feel, is an important language to just understand and know (quite fundamental).
			I'm working on building more web apps that people can use on all devices.
